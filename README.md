"CUT IT OUT, CLAUDE." doesn't work.

"Oh look, somehow you failed linting, how rough for you, better fix it!" does.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add `rubocop-claude` to your gemfile.
2. Bundle.
3. Run `rubocop-claude init .` to set up the Claude integration files


# Claude Changes

This adds a linting.md to your .claude folder, and appends a set of instructions to the CLAUDE.md for this repository. `linting.md` links to a number of targeted docs so that when Claudes find an offense, they can go read about it once rather than trying to remember every rule every time.

# New Cops

TODO: fill this in, with config examples.
